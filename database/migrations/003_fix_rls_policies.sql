-- Migration: Fix RLS policies to avoid infinite recursion
-- Date: 2025-09-05  
-- Description: Corrects circular reference in organization_users policies

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view org members" ON organization_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view org invites" ON organization_invites;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view org usage" ON usage_tracking;

-- Create fixed policies with proper logic

-- This uses a direct user_id check instead of recursive lookup
